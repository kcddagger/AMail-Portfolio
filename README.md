**AMail Portfolio**

This is the final stopping point that was agreed on for this training project.

AMail is an MVC 5 CORE 2 project that was used to get me, a newly graduated programmer, up to speed with the methods and styles of the current programmers on staff at Alkota Cleaning Solutions, Inc.

AMail was a project that was written inside of 6 weeks to see what I knew and what I needed to learn.  Learning happened as the project progressed.

This project also allowed me to display some of my strengths to the company, one of them being that I was more UI oriented than my partner on this project.

This was a collaboration between Crystal Buckneberg and Brad Mandery, and is posted to my portfolio with permission of Brad Mandery.

The files in the Zip should be enough to allow a person to see what was done and if they really wished to, with permission, launch AMail to an IIS7 server to get a visual of what was done and implimented in the 6 weeks.

This was a very limited project and many ideas and features that were brought up as possibilities were not implimented due to the time limit on this project as a training project.  However it was reasonably well executed in my opinion and I hope at some point to put up screen shots of what was done on my portfolio site.

I was able to get the screenshots of most of the processes of the AMail program.  They can be found at http://crb.kcddagger.com/?p=mvc5 if you should desire to take a look at it without having to install the whole project.
