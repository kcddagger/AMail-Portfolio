AMail Portfolio

This is the final stopping point that was agreed on for this training project.

AMail is an MVC 5 CORE 2 project that was used to get me, a newly graduated programmer, up to speed with the methods and styles of the current programmers on staff at Alkota Cleaning Solutions, Inc.

AMail was a project that was written inside of 6 weeks to see what I knew and what I needed to learn.  Learning happened as the project progressed. 
This project also allowed me to display some of my strengths to the company, one of them being that I was more UI oriented than my partner on this project. 
This was a collaboration between Crystal Buckneberg and Brad Mandery, and is posted to my portfolio with permission of Brad Mandery.
